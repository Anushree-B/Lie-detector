Political Speech Lie Detection Model with Sentence Analysis using Neural Networks
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project exploring the use of sentence analysis and a neural network model to identify potential deception in political speech.

## Data:

The dataset consists of 14400 quotes scraped from website www.politifact.com , each labelled as true, false, half-true, barely true, etc.
## Analysis:

The project focuses on sentence-level analysis of the quotes, extracting features such as:
- Sentence length and complexity
- Part-of-speech distribution (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
- Sentiment analysis
- Vocabulary choice and n-gram analysis
These features aim to identify potential linguistic patterns associated with truthfulness.
## Model Development:

The extracted sentence-level features will be integrated with other potential features (e.g., politician's background, topic of the quote) for training a neural network model.
The chosen neural network architecture will be optimized for text classification tasks.
The model will be evaluated on its ability to distinguish truthful from deceptive quotes.
